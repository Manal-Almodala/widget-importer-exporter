#!/bin/bash
#
# Run ./deploy to deploy plugin to WordPress.org plugin directory. This also makes archive zip in
# Releases folder. It respects .gitignore, .gitignore_global and .gitattributes (export-ignore).
# WordPress.org assets (icon and screenshots) are stored in .wpo-assets.
#
# Also see buttons.jsonc which uses vscode-buttons extension for convenient execution.
#
# Three options are given: 1) Release new version, 2) Update readme.txt or assets, and
# 3) Make manual changes such as deletions
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
# 1) Set environment variables (see variables.zsh and script commons)
# 2) Make this script executable: chmod +x deploy
# 3) Folder must exist at $CT_PLUGIN_PRODUCTS/$NAME/Releases
# 4) System must have WordPress.org keychain access
# 5) Requires 'brew install git-archive-all': https://github.com/Kentzo/git-archive-all
#	 This helps include any submodules, which native 'git archive-all' doesn't do easily.
